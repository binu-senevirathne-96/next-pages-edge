# Perfect Homemade Pasta: A Step-by-Step Guide

There's nothing quite like the taste and texture of fresh, homemade pasta. In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of making perfect pasta from scratch.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Water, as needed

## Equipment

- Large mixing bowl
- Fork or dough whisk
- Clean work surface
- Pasta machine or rolling pin
- Sharp knife or pasta cutter

## Step 1: Make the Dough

Start by creating a mound of flour on your clean work surface. Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the eggs into it. Add the salt and olive oil.

Using a fork, beat the eggs gently, gradually incorporating the flour from the sides of the well. Continue until the mixture becomes too thick for the fork.

## Step 2: Knead the Dough

Use your hands to bring the remaining flour into the dough. Knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If it feels too dry, add a little water; if too sticky, add more flour.

## Step 3: Rest the Dough

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.

## Step 4: Roll and Cut

Divide the dough into smaller portions. Using a pasta machine or rolling pin, roll each portion into thin sheets. For hand-cut pasta, fold the sheets and cut to your desired width.

## Step 5: Cook and Serve

Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta—usually just 2-3 minutes in boiling salted water. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce.

## Tips for Success

- Keep the dough covered when not in use to prevent it from drying out
- Dust your work surface and pasta with flour to prevent sticking
- For colored pasta, add ingredients like spinach, beet, or squid ink to the dough
- Fresh pasta can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for longer storage

Enjoy your homemade pasta with a simple sauce that lets the pasta shine. A classic butter and sage sauce or a light tomato sauce works perfectly!

# The Art of Sourdough: Creating and Maintaining Your Starter

Sourdough bread has experienced a renaissance in recent years, and for good reason. The complex flavors, chewy texture, and health benefits make it a favorite among bread enthusiasts. At the heart of every great sourdough is a healthy, active starter.

## What is a Sourdough Starter?

A sourdough starter is a fermented mixture of flour and water containing wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. These microorganisms are responsible for leavening the bread and developing its characteristic tangy flavor.

## Creating Your Starter from Scratch

### Day 1:
- Mix 50g whole wheat flour (or rye flour) with 50g water at room temperature
- Stir until no dry flour remains
- Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature (70-75°F/21-24°C) for 24 hours

### Days 2-7:
- Discard all but 50g of the starter
- Add 50g flour and 50g water
- Mix well and cover loosely
- Let sit at room temperature for 24 hours
- Repeat this process daily

By day 7, your starter should be doubling in size within 8-12 hours after feeding and showing plenty of bubbles. If not, continue the feeding process for a few more days.

## Maintaining Your Starter

### Regular Feeding Schedule:
- For an active starter used frequently: Feed once daily at room temperature
- For less frequent use: Store in the refrigerator and feed once weekly

### Feeding Ratio:
A common ratio is 1:1:1 (starter:flour:water by weight)
- 50g starter
- 50g flour
- 50g water

### Signs of a Healthy Starter:
- Doubles in size within 4-8 hours after feeding
- Plenty of bubbles throughout
- Pleasant, tangy aroma (like yogurt or beer)
- Consistent rise and fall pattern

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Starter isn't rising
**Solutions:**
- Ensure your room temperature is warm enough (70-75°F/21-24°C)
- Try using filtered water instead of tap water
- Add a small amount of rye flour to your feeding
- Be patient—new starters can take 2-3 weeks to become fully active

### Problem: Strange odor (acetone/nail polish remover)
**Solution:** Your starter is hungry! Feed it more frequently or increase the amount of flour in your feeding.

### Problem: Mold or discoloration
**Solution:** If you see pink, orange, or blue mold, discard your starter and begin again. A thin layer of liquid (hooch) on top is normal and can be stirred back in or poured off.

## Using Your Starter

Your starter is ready to use when it reliably doubles in size and is full of bubbles. For best results, use your starter at its peak rise or just as it begins to fall.

Most sourdough bread recipes call for "active" or "fed" starter, meaning starter that has been fed 4-12 hours before using it in your dough.

## Storing Your Starter

If you won't be baking for a while, you can store your starter in the refrigerator. Feed it, let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours, then refrigerate. It will need to be fed about once a week.

For long-term storage, you can dry your starter or freeze it.

## Conclusion

Creating and maintaining a sourdough starter is both a science and an art. With patience and consistent care, your starter will become a reliable companion for creating delicious sourdough bread for years to come.
